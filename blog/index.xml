Neovim is a text editor based on Vim. It is extremely extensible, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be taking advantage of that to edit on Fandom wikis.
Install Neovim (but Vim should also work for this guide). It might already be on your Linux computer. You will also need an installation of Python.
First, execute pip install mwclient in your terminal.</description></item><item><title>How I Transcribe Handwritten Notes Into Obsidian</title><link>https://tomodachi94.github.io/blog/handwritten-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomodachi94.github.io/blog/handwritten-notes/</guid><description>Obsidian is a Markdown-based note taking tool focused on connections between notes.
