Hey there! I'm Tomodachi94, a programmer, gamer, wiki editor, and amateur archivist. This website hosts random stuff I write and want to share with the world.

## What do you do?

I am pretty active in open source; I maintain [several packages for Nixpkgs](https://repology.org/maintainer/tomodachi94+nixpkgs@protonmail.com), as well as a [niche package manager](https://unicornpkg.madefor.cc) and [the Awesome list](https://github.com/tomodachi94/awesome-computercraft) of that same niche.

I am also active on [Wikimedia projects](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Tomodachi94), most notably [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org/). I am also somewhat active on the [FTB Wiki](https://ftb.fandom.com), the premier source of information on modded Minecraft.

I occasionally help out with [ArchiveTeam](https://archiveteam.org), especially when they do stuff involving my hobbies and interests.

## What tech do you use?

I'm a diehard Linux Mint user (but I plan on switching to NixOS when I have the time!). I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io) as my day-to-day editor, and I use [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) as my preferred browser. I use [the i3 window manager](https://i3wm.org/). My configurations for most of these programs is made publically available [on GitHub](https://github.com/tomodachi94/dotfiles).

As far as programming languages, I use [Python](https://python.org) and [Lua](https://lua.org), and I'm trying to learn [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

## How can I talk to you?

I'm on <a rel="me" href="https://floss.social/@tomodachi94">Mastodon</a>, [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@tomodachi94:matrix.org), and [GitHub](https://github.com/tomodachi94). On most websites I use the handle `tomodachi94`, so there's a good chance you're talking to me if someone is using that handle. (If you're unsure, I usually provide links to my Mastodon and Matrix accounts to make things clearer.) I also have [a PGP key](/tomodachi94.asc).

Please don't use the links above for bug reports or feature requests; file an issue in the respective GitHub project instead.
